### How can we automate our radio mapping easier

To automate our mapping of signals we receive, we have to decide on the frequencies we want to listen to and how big of a bin size we need for rtl_power to be able to accurately report the strength of the signal. We can do this by planning how the rtl_power will run and by researching on the local frequencies (radios and such).
