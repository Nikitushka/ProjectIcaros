# Trying out Kismet on Raspberry Pi

Now that I had tried out **airmon-ng** and **kismet** on my laptop it'd be time to bring things over to the **Raspberry Pi**. The model I have is the **3B+**, which has an integrated WiFi adapter. There were no guarantees that the WiFi adapter could be brought up to monitoring mode, but we would find that out during the course of this little excersice.
