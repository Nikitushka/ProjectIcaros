# Introduction
This document serves as an index of different types of competitors we have in terms of mapping radiotransmitters and signals.

The criteria for being selected as a "competitor" are google queries containing "sdr map", "radio transmitter map" and "wireless signal map".

Specific keywords will be **boldened** and explained at the bottom of this file. 

# Competitors:
## [fmscan](https://fmscan.org/)
#### [From fmscan's help page:](https://fmscan.org/help-en.htm "FMSCAN  - frequencies for any place and transmitter maps")
_The FM band looks different wherever you go._

_If you only a move into the next city there will be different stations on other frequencies. FMSCAN can calculate what to expect. It's a free tool.
Whether you just want to take a closer look at your stations at home or you are about to travel some distant spot - this tool helps to explore FM and AM radio._

#### _Transmitter maps_
_The Network Maps section makes it easy to find frequencies of a specific station if you're moving through a certain area. This has been automatized with the RDS technology. But RDS often fails with weaker stations. Setting the frequency manually might deliver you many more stations than RDS would find._

#### _FMLIST - the world-wide frequency database_
_Part of the data come from public sources. In addition to that FMLIST includes many observations from people who like to listen to distant stations (DXers). These hobbyists are also the most intense users of the database. Combining all this information makes FMLIST unique. In Southern Europe for example you won't gain much from the official sources. FMLIST has become very comprehensive over the years. GÃ¼nter Lorenz started the FMLIST project in Germany in the late 80ies. FMSCAN and FMMAP have been on the internet since 2000._

The map feature only shows radio towers, but clicking on said towers in the map can display which radio stations and frequencies are broadcasted from them.

## [CellMapper](cellmapper.net/map "Cellular Tower and Signal Map")
#### [From CellMapper's FAQ:](https://cellmapper.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/28000006999-what-is-the-cellmapper- "What is the CellMapper? : CellMapper")
_CellMapper is Cellular Coverage Map application. On CellMapper Map you can check your own provider mobile network coverage. Also you can see your provider mobile tower locations on map._

The map itself displays different **air interfaces** and network coverage for 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G networks for providers world-wide. The UI also provided possibilities to search for locations, towers, **BSIC** (Base Station Identity Code), **PCI** (Physical Cell Identifiers), **PSC** (Primary Scrambling Code), along with applying different filters for searching.

# Glossary
**air interface** = _In cellular telephone communications, the air interface is the radio-frequency portion of the circuit between the cellular phone set or wireless modem (usually portable or mobile) and the active base station._ Source: [searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com](https://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/air-interface#:~:text=In%20cellular%20telephone%20communications%2C%20the,and%20the%20active%20base%20station.)
