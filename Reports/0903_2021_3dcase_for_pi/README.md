# Creating a case for the Raspberry Pi 3

We needed a case to hold our **Raspberry Pi** if we were to use it on the move. I was familiar with **Blender** the 3D modeling software.

We'd need to secure the **Raspi** to the case by some means, most obvious being with screws, since the **Raspi** comes with 4 mounting holes. I found the mechanical dimensions of the **Pi 3** from [raspberrypi-spy.co.uk.](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2018/03/introducing-raspberry-pi-3-b-plus-computer/)

I had to make a rough model of the **Raspi** first, so that the case could be designed around the major components.
