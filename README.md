## 17.04 Placing markers on the map with API data

When the device has scanned either SDR frequencies or WiFi signals, and placed itself on the map via GPS coordinates or such the data should be displayed on the map. This is now possible through the **API**. Check out the full report [here.](./Reports/1704_2021_markersfromapi/README.md)
